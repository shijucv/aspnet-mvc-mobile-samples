## Mobile Features of ASP.NET MVC

These samples demonstrate specific features of ASP.NET MVC related to targeting mobile devices.

The samples and supporting articles were authored by [Akira Inoue](https://github.com/chack411) of Microsoft Japan. Akira can also be found on [twitter](http://twitter.com/chack411).

* [Mvc3_ViewSwitcher](/tree/master/Mvc3_ViewSwitcher) demonstrates how to switch between a mobile view and a desktop view using ASP.NET MVC 3.
* [Mvc_ViewSwitcher](/tree/master/Mvc_ViewSwitcher) demonstrates how to switch views using new features in the forthcoming ASP.NET MVC 4.

## Running the Samples

These samples require Visual Studio 2010. Find out how to obtain a **free** copy of Visual Studio Web Developer Express at the official [ASP.NET site](http://www.asp.net/mvc).

You can also download a developer preview of [ASP.NET MVC 4](http://www.asp.net/mvc/mvc4) that can be installed side-by-side with ASP.NET MVC 3.

Finally, you'll want to install [NuGet](http://www.nuget.org/) in order to manage the dependencies.
